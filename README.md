## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Streamlit:**  For the beautiful and easy-to-use web interface. 🎈
*   **Groq API (Distil Whisper):**  For super-fast and accurate voice transcription. 🧠
*   **Python:**  The language that makes it all happen. 🐍
*   **SoundDevice:**  For capturing audio from your microphone. 🎤
*   **Wave:**  For handling audio file operations. 🌊
*   **Pyperclip:**  For the handy "Copy to Clipboard" feature. 📎

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository (if you have one):**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    cd voice_dictation_app
    ```
    *(If you just have the `voice_dictation.py` file, simply navigate to the folder containing it in your terminal.)*

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8 or higher). Then, use `pip` to install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If you don't have `requirements.txt`, you can create one as described in the previous instructions, or install them manually: `pip install streamlit sounddevice wave pyperclip groq-python`)*

    **Important Note for `sounddevice` installation:** You might need to install `portaudio` separately. See the installation instructions in the main `voice_dictation.py` file or in previous responses for details specific to your operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows).

3.  **Get your Groq API Key:**
    Sign up for a Groq account and get your API key from the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys). It's quick and easy! 🔑

4.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run voice_dictation.py
    ```

5.  **Open in your browser:**
    Streamlit will provide you with a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`). Open this URL in your web browser to access the app. 🌐

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

1.  **Enter your Groq API Key:**  Type or paste your API key into the "Enter Groq API Key" text box. 🔑
2.  **Click the "Record" button:**  The button will turn red and the app will start recording your voice. 🔴
3.  **Speak clearly into your microphone.** 🗣️
4.  **Click the "Record" button again to stop recording.**  The recording will stop, and the app will start processing your audio. ⏹️
5.  **See your transcribed text appear instantly!** ✨ The transcribed text will be displayed in the "Transcribed Text" area.
6.  **Click "Copy to Clipboard"** to copy the transcribed text to your clipboard. 📋
